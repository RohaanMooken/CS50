Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

All of the predictions were wrong seeing as every single on put belgium with 21.1% at the top, however, belgium came third
while France who came first was predicted at 3.3%. And England who came third got a prediction of 2.8%

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say 100000 simulations are is good enough seeing as its under 1 second as the predictions are fairly
close to the ones outputed by the 1000000 simulations one. However, if the fee was super high i'd say 10000 not
perfect enough scores, but close, and people are mostly interested in the top ones.
